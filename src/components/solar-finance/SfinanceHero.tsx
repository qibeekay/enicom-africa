						<p className='w-full leading-6 md:w-[85%] text-center mx-auto text-white mt-3'>
							Solar energy systems can be expensive, costing thousands or even
							tens of thousands of naira. It's completely understandable to feel
							hesitant about investing in solar energy because of the high
							upfront costs involved. Fortunately, there are financing options
							available that can help homeowners benefit from solar energy
							savings, without having to pay a huge sum of money upfront. Some
							of these financing options offer little to no down payment, making
							it easier for homeowners to switch to solar energy even if they
							donâ€™t have a lump sum of savings.
